DS2Compress's GUI is based on CATSFC's GUI.

CATSFC (C) 2010-2013 dking <dking024@gmail.com>,
  GBAtemp users BassAceGold, ShadauxCat and Nebuleon.

CATSFC is released under the same license as DS2Compress, the GNU General
Public License version 2 or later. See the license text above.

Many files have been removed as they are unnecessary for the operation of
DS2Compress. Those files deal with SNES emulation.

The entire source code for CATSFC is available at
<http://github.com/ShadauxCat/CATSFC>.

gzip (C) 1992-1993 Jean-Loup Gailly, Mark Adler.

gzip is released under the same license as DS2Compress, the GNU General Public
License version 2 or later. See the license text above.

This software may be covered by software interoperability laws in some
countries, as gzip is an established compression format.

Some files have been removed as they are unnecessary for the operation of
DS2Compress. Those files are mainly documentation for users dealing with the
command-line version of gzip, documentation of the algorithm and auxiliary
executables such as zcat.

The entire source code for gzip is available at <http://www.gzip.org/>.

Compression tool icon from the Oropax.200 Icon Set by deviantART user 878952.

Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 License.

This icon is used in DS2Compress with the understanding that this is a
non-commercial project. If you wish to resell DS2Compress, you will need to use
a different icon. This does not affect the GPL status of the program's code.

This icon is used in DS2Compress with the assumption that cutting white from
an icon and showing its main part is not a derivative work, in the same way
that cutting silence from a music track is not a derivative work. Either way,
using the icon in an application may make it a derivative work of the icon.
If this is a problem, the application will need to use a different icon.
